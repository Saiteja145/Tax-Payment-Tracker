2. System Architecture

  2.1. Overview

       The Tax Payment Tracker follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend is developed using Flask, a Python web framework. The application uses SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact with the database.

  2.2. Frontend Technologies
The frontend of the Tax Payment Tracker is built using the following technologies:
HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
CSS: Used for styling the web pages and creating a visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript: Used for implementing dynamic behaviour and interactivity on the client-side.
Bootstrap: A CSS framework used for creating responsive and mobile-friendly designs.

  2.3. Backend Technologies
       The backend of the Tax Payment Tracker is developed using the following technologies:

Flask: A lightweight and flexible Python web framework used for building the server-side application.
SQLAlchemy: An ORM tool used for interacting with the database and handling database operations.
SQLite: A lightweight and file-based relational database used for storing the tax payment records.

  2.4. Communication Flow
       The communication flow between the frontend and backend of the Tax Payment Tracker is as follows:

The user interacts with the frontend by adding, editing, or deleting tax payment records through the user interface.
The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints using JavaScript's `fetch` function.
The backend receives the requests, processes them, and interacts with the database using SQLAlchemy to perform the necessary operations (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting records).
The backend sends back HTTP responses to the frontend, typically in JSON format, containing the requested data or the status of the operation.
The frontend receives the responses and updates the user interface accordingly, displaying the updated data or showing success/error messages.

  2.5. Scalability and Extensibility

       The Tax Payment Tracker is designed with scalability and extensibility in mind. The separation of concerns between the frontend and backend allows for independent development and maintenance of each component. The use of Flask and SQLAlchemy provides flexibility in adding new features or modifying existing functionality on the backend. The frontend can be easily extended to include additional user interface components or interact with other APIs if needed.



3. Backend Code
  3.1. Code Structure and Organization

       The backend code of the Tax Payment Tracker is organized into a single Python file, typically named `app.py` or `main.py`. The file contains the necessary imports, configuration settings, database models, and route handlers.

  3.2. Database Connection and Configuration

       The database connection and configuration are handled using SQLAlchemy. Here's an example of how the database connection is established:


  
 from flask import Flask
       from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

       app = Flask(__name__)
       app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///tax_payments.db'
       app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

       db = SQLAlchemy(app)
       


       In this code snippet, the Flask application is created, and the database URI is configured to use SQLite with a file named `tax_payments.db`. The `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS` configuration is set to `False` to disable tracking modifications, which is not needed in this case.

  3.3. SQL Schema

       The SQL schema for the Tax Payment Tracker is defined using SQLAlchemy's declarative base. Here's an example of the `TaxPayment` model definition:

   

 class TaxPayment(db.Model):
           id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
           company = db.Column(db.String(100))
           amount = db.Column(db.Float)
           payment_date = db.Column(db.DateTime)
           status = db.Column(db.String(50))
           due_date = db.Column(db.DateTime)

           def to_dict(self):
               return {
                   "id": self.id,
                   "company": self.company,
                   "amount": self.amount,
                   "payment_date": self.payment_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') if self.payment_date else None,
                   "status": self.status,
                   "due_date": self.due_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') if self.due_date else None
               }

          


  3.4. Database Schema
       The Tax Payment Tracker application uses a single database table named `tax_payments` to store the tax payment records. The table has the following schema:
       | Column       | Type         | Description                                
       |--------------|--------------|----------------------------------
       | id           | INTEGER      | Primary key for the payment record         
       | company      | VARCHAR(100) | Name of the company                        
       | amount       | FLOAT        | Payment amount                             
       | payment_date | DATETIME     | Date when the payment was made             
       | status       | VARCHAR(50)  | Status of the payment     
       | due_date     | DATETIME     | Due date of the payment                    


       The `TaxPayment` model represents the structure of the tax payment records in the database. It defines the columns of the table, including `id` (primary key), `company`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`, and `due_date`. The `to_dict` method is used to convert the model instance to a dictionary for easier serialisation.

  3.4. Controllers and Endpoints

       The backend code contains several route handlers that define the endpoints for interacting with the tax payment records. Here are the main endpoints and their corresponding controller functions:

`GET /api/payments`: Retrieves all tax payment records or filtered records based on the due date.
`POST /api/payments`: Creates a new tax payment record.
`PUT /api/payments/<int:payment_id>`: Updates an existing tax payment record.
DELETE /api/payments/<int:payment_id>`: Deletes a tax payment record.

       Each endpoint is implemented as a separate function decorated with the appropriate HTTP method and route. The functions handle the request data, interact with the database using SQLAlchemy, and return the appropriate response.

  3.5. Error Handling

       The backend code includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and return appropriate error responses to the frontend. Common error scenarios, such as missing required fields or invalid data, are handled by returning descriptive error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.

       Additionally, a generic error handler is implemented using Flask's `@app.errorhandler` decorator to catch any unhandled exceptions and return a JSON response with the error message.

5. Frontend Code

  5.1. Code Structure and Organization

       The frontend code of the Tax Payment Tracker is organized into a single HTML file, typically named `index.html`. The file contains the HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript code required for the user interface and interactions.

  5.2. Main HTML Sections

       The HTML code is divided into several main sections:

Header: Contains the title and navigation elements of the application.
Add/Edit Payment Modal: Displays a modal dialog for adding or editing tax payment records.
Payments Table: Displays a table listing all the tax payment records.
Filter and Summary Section: Allows filtering payments by due date and calculates the total amount and tax due.

  5.3. JavaScript Functions

       The frontend code includes several JavaScript functions to handle user interactions and data manipulation:

`setupDueDateDropdowns()`: Populates the due date dropdown menus with available options.
`setupEventListeners()`: Attaches event listeners to form submission, due date selection, and tax rate input.
`fetchPayments()`: Fetches the list of tax payments from the backend API.
`populatePaymentsTable(payments)`: Populates the payments table with the fetched data.
`submitForm(event)`: Handles the form submission for adding or editing a tax payment.
`editPayment(id)`: Retrieves the details of a specific payment for editing.
`deletePayment(id)`: Deletes a specific payment.
`updatePaymentsSummary()`: Updates the filtered payments table and calculates the total amount and tax due.

       These functions interact with the backend API using JavaScript's `fetch` function to send HTTP requests and handle the responses.

  5.4. Event Listeners and Form Submission

       The frontend code sets up event listeners to handle user interactions:

The `paymentForm` is submitted using the `submitForm(event)` function.
The `filter_due_date` dropdown triggers the `updatePaymentsSummary()` function when a due date is selected.
The `taxRate` input triggers the `updatePaymentsSummary()` function when the tax rate is changed.

       The `submitForm(event)` function prevents the default form submission behavior, collects the form data, and sends a POST or PUT request to the backend API depending on whether it's a new payment or an update to an existing payment.

  5.5. Data Fetching and Displaying

       The `fetchPayments()` function is used to retrieve the list of tax payments from the backend API. It sends a GET request to the `/api/payments` endpoint and handles the response.

       The `populatePaymentsTable(payments)` function is responsible for displaying the fetched payments in the payments table. It clears the existing table rows and generates new rows based on the payment data.

       The `updatePaymentsSummary()` function is triggered when the user selects a due date or changes the tax rate. It fetches the filtered payments based on the selected due date, populates the filtered payments table, and calculates the total amount and tax due.

  5.6. Editing and Deleting Payments

       The `editPayment(id)` function is called when the user clicks the "Edit" button for a specific payment. It fetches the payment details from the backend API using the payment ID and populates the Add/Edit Payment modal with the retrieved data.

       The `deletePayment(id)` function is called when the user clicks the "Delete" button for a specific payment. It sends a DELETE request to the backend API with the payment ID to delete the corresponding payment record.
